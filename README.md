# Cloud Web App - CSS Layout Challenge 

## Description: 
Build out the solution (layout and design) based on the original design by [Imran on Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/10747116-Cloud-Web-App). 
The challenge was created by [Dave Ceddia](https://github.com/dceddia/css-layout-challenge).

## Technology:
HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox and CSS Grids).

## Challenges:
Creating the table like layout in the 'Recent Files' section. Instead of Flexbox (which would have been easier) I chose to use the Grid template areas (new concept for me). With the help of a few resources, I was able to create a mobile first responsive layout using the Grid template areas.
