# Cloud Web App - CSS Layout Challenge 

### Description: 
This [challenge](https://github.com/dceddia/css-layout-challenge) created by [Dave Ceddia](https://daveceddia.com/about/) was to build out the solution (layout and design) to an original design by [Imran on Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/10747116-Cloud-Web-App). This was a great project to practice Flexbox and CSS Grids layout techniques. 

### Built with:
HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox and CSS Grids).

### Challenges:
Creating the table like layout in the 'Recent Files' section. Instead of Flexbox (which would have been easier) I chose to use the Grid template areas (new for me). With the help of a few resources, I was able to create a mobile first responsive layout and practice using Grid template areas.
